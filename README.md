# How it Works.
With the help of [Anarchy-Wrapper](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Anarchy-wrapper/) the program can control a lot of things in Discord and make almost everything possible.

# Installing packages:
Here are all the packages you will need to install:
<br>
Anarchy-Wrapper 0.8.0.1
<br>
Newtonsoft.Json
<br>
System.IO.Compression

# About the project:
This project was created by Me, I left this project because I no longer have interest in it.
So I decided to the public it and make it possible for everyone to learn or fix it.
(I haven't finished the program so there might be some bugs or missing checks.)
